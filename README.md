# Batch MessageBox

This is a tiny hack to display message boxes from Windows batch files and
command line programs. There are many like it but I didn't find any that was
open source, non-copyleft and had no external dependencies like the .NET
Framework.

## Binaries

Available from the [Releases](https://github.com/dbohdan/messagebox/releases)
page on GitHub.

## Build requirements

tests.
